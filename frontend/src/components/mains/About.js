                    As written at the home page, my name is Fero, and I'm a guitarist, 
                    song-writer and a busker based in London. But my friend Alex once said 
                    "London has many faces". And just like London, I too, have many faces.

                    <span className="about-face">The guitar face</span>. Unlike many people, who
                    start playing in their childhood and drop the instrument when starting uni, 
                    I've done the opposite and made my first strums on a classical guitar when I was
                    18. I soon realized that I enjoy improvising (even though it must have sounded 
                    terrible back then!) and after the obligatory pentatonics, I started to explore
                    more of the music theory. Luckily, my teacher - Ali Kovac - was one of the more
                    progressive ones and after a few years of improving my technique through 
                    classical guitar, we moved on to do electric guitar, blues, extended scales and
                    much more.

                    One of the breakthroughs for me was discovering the music of Dire Straits and
                    Mark Knopfler. I still remember that moment. We were in London over summer of 2008, 
                    sort of work &amp; travel thing. One day, we were in our shitty room at Walthamstow, 
                    as usual bitching 
                    about not earning enough money with our minimum-wage jobs. At some point, 
                    when we had enough, my friend Roman (a long-standing Dire Straits fan) played me 
                    the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4E_924b9SU&feature=youtu.be&t=250">first solo from Telegraph road </a>.
                    I somehow got it on my iPod and that was it. Since then, literally every day on 
                    the way to and from work, I would listen to that solo over
                    and over again. I found it absolutely captivating, beautiful and somewhat 
                    special - it was simply something I've never found in music before. Roman's "recommender"
                    system kicked in soon after and suggested another one,
                    the <a href="https://youtu.be/gAirINwjaxE?t=343">outro of Tunnel of love</a>, which 
                    became the first proper solo that I learned (and subsequently played over and over 
                    again like a broken radio). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By that time though, I was hooked enough, and I went on to listen to anything that 
                    Dire Straits or Mark made, learned countless of the songs, seen him 5 times and 
                    tried to unravel the beauty of his playing. If there's one thing that I know for sure
                    that I'll never get tired of, it is Mark's music. For although it has been now 
                    close to 12 years since that moment in Walthamstow, I still listen to Telegraph road
                    with the same enthusiasm and its first solo is, if anything, even more beautiful than
                    it was back then.

                    Other than Dire Strais/Mark Knopfler, I find a lot of inspiration in 
                    John Mayer's music - 
                    always superbly produced, and a rare combination of relatively pop-y and 
                    mainstream genre with intelligent and melodic guitar playing, one that can be 
                    easily be deemed "cool" by any guitarist's standards.

                    Other than that, Tommy Emmanuel's energy, technique and beautiful acoustic 
                    melodies are frequently seen on my playlists, and so are some of the more David 
                    Gilmour oriented Pink Floyd songs (e.g. Coming back to life). Bruce Springsteen, 
                    Gary Moore, Eric Clapton, Simon &amp; Garfunkel and others further 
                    shaped my taste in music and playing.

                    Finally, I am definitely a sucker for mainstream stuff too - simple, melodic songs that
                    render themselves nicely to duo-projects, harmonizing, perhaps a simple loop with a 
                    solo on top. Ed Sheeran, Katie Melua or soundtracks from musicals form big chunks
                    of my songbook and ocassional jam-times with singers.
